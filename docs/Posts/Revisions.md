In the revision history section of a post you can see the list of revisions in reverse chronological order.

Some properties will tell you what changed, but others with more content, like `body` will have a link to another page to view the revision.

You can also filter the list by field.

On this page you will see the current value.

On the right of that panel you will see buttons to toggle the view, and you can click changes to see what actually changed compared to the previous revision.
